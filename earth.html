  <h3>Our Home Planet</h3>
 
<div id="EIntro">
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and largest of the terrestrial planets. Surprisingly, while it is only the fifth largest planet in terms of size and mass, 
  it is the densest (5,513 kg/m3) of all the planets. Earth is the only planet in the solar system not named after a mythological being. Instead, its name is derived 
  from the Old English word "ertha" and the Anglo-Saxon word "erda" which means ground or soil.Earth was formed somewhere around 4.54 billion years ago and is currently the only known 
  planet to support life - and lots of it.

<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>
Remarkably, the significant amount of oxygen present in the atmosphere is due to the life found on Earth. As a byproduct of making sugars, plants convert the carbon dioxide in the 
  atmosphere into oxygen. Essentially, this means that without plants the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would be much greater and the oxygen levels much lower. 
  On one hand, if carbon dioxide levels were much higher, it is likely the Earth would suffer from a runaway greenhouse effect like that on Venus. On the other hand, 
  if the percentage of carbon dioxide were any lower there would not be a greenhouse effect at all, thus making temperatures far colder. Therefore, the carbon dioxide levels are just 
  right to maintain hospitable temeperatures ranging from -88° C to 58° C</p>
