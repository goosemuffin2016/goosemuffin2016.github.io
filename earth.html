<h1>Earth</h1>
  <h3>Our Home Planet</h3>
 
<div id="EIntro">
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and largest of the terrestrial planets. Surprisingly, while it is only the fifth largest planet in terms of size and mass, it is the densest (5,513 kg/m3) of all the planets. Earth is the only planet in the solar system not named after a mythological being. Instead, its name is derived from the Old English word "ertha" and the Anglo-Saxon word "erda" which means ground or soil.
Earth was formed somewhere around 4.54 billion years ago and is currently the only known planet to support life - and lots of it.

<h3>Atmosphere and Climate</h3>
<p>
Essentially, objects with less than a certain amount of kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater. And incoming projectiles 
less than 50 meters in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.
Surface observations of Venus have been difficult in the past, due to its extremely dense atmosphere, which is composed primarily of carbon dioxide with a small amount of nitrogen. 
At 92 bar (9.2 MPa), the atmospheric mass is 93 times that of Earth’s atmosphere and the pressure at the planet’s surface is about 92 times that at Earth’s surface.Venus is also the hottest
planet in our Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C/863.6 °F). This is due to the CO²-rich atmosphere which, along with thick clouds of sulfur dioxide, 
generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System. Above the dense CO² layer, thick clouds consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets scatter about 
90% of the sunlight back into space.The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal, which means that their is virtually no variation in Venus’ surface temperature between day and night, 
or the equator and the poles.The planet’s minute axial tilt – less than 3° compared to Earth’s 23° – also minimizes seasonal temperature variation. The only appreciable variation in 
temperature occurs with altitude.The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on the planet, with a temperature of about 655 K (380 °C) and an atmospheric 
pressure of about 4.5 MPa (45 bar).</p>
